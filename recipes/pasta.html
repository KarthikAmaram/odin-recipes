        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home? This homemade pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store — 
            and it’s surprisingly easy to throw together with just five ingredients you likely already have on hand!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of flour</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a bowl until combined.
                 Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to flour mixture until a smooth, thick dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 8 balls; use a pasta machine to roll and cut dough into desired pasta shape.</li>
        </ol>
